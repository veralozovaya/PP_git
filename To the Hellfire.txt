I'll hold onto feeling
Until my final breath escapes
Gazing upon this world
Fall with me into the other night
We can go beyond the horizon again
Fall with me until we're out of time
Let the current swallow
These whispers keep clawing
Your mind is dissolving light
Sink while you bathe in hallucination
Accept this descent into the night
Releasing your grasp to induce separation
Plunged into the shadows
Lost in sensation, we're free falling down into the everblack
Can you feel it? These pins and needles
See what you have found here
You fell into the dark
Release your grip and face the tide
Accepting this damnation
Relinquish flesh temptation
Of the body and soul
The ebb and the flow, nothing confessed
Put me to rest
Azrael
Guiding me beyond the veil
Obitual
Free me from this mortal shell
Enter into the darkest night
I will sink where I lie
Through the sands of time
Through the angel's eye
My final breath
Swallowed by the womb of death
Swallowed by the womb of death
Whispers are clawing
Your mind is dissolving light
Enter the void and fall with me (with me)
Fall with me (with me)
Enter the void
Release your grip and face the tide accepting this damnation
Relinquish flesh temptation
Of the body and soul
The ebb and the flow, nothing confessed
Put me to rest
Azrael
Guiding me beyond the veil
Obitual
Free me of this mortal shell
Enter into the darkest night
I will sink where I lie
My final breath
Swallowed by the womb of death
Swallowed by the womb of death
Swallowed by the womb of death
Sink while you bathe in hallucination
My final breath
Swallowed by the womb of death
As you pass through the fucking gate
Descending towards the end faster
